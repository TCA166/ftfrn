But with gain of our independence we gained the power to repeal it and from today onward it will be history. \n\nHowever few politicians with Oven Morgan at lead are concerned about how dirastic changes are made so fast and propose some changes to our new legislations to make it more frendly to Anglicised part of population.

Mabe we should accept those demands, or mabe those imperialist scumbags only will learn if we commit to more drastic steps."
 morocco.5.d:0 "We told French soldiers to move to new location of their evacuation.Little did they known that this will be their last travel. They were led deep into desert and when the order was given our troops to deal with them. \n\nUnfortunetly the French government was made aware of the massacre and was outraged by our deeds and turned it into a crisis and sent us sent us outrageous ultimatum that demands us to literally become a French puppet."
